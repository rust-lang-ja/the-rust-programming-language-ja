 This means that even if someone does something bad like add methods to `i32`,
 it won’t affect you, unless you `use` that trait.

 One last thing about traits: generic functions with a trait bound use
 ‘monomorphization’ (mono: one, morph: form), so they are statically dispatched.
 What’s that mean? Check out the chapter on [trait objects][to] for more details.

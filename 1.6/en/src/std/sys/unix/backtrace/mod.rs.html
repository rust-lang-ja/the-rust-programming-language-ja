<span class='doccomment'>/// Backtrace support built on libgcc with some extra OS-specific support</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// Some methods of getting a backtrace:</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// * The backtrace() functions on unix. It turns out this doesn&#39;t work very</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   well for green threads on OSX, and the address to symbol portion of it</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   suffers problems that are described below.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// * Using libunwind. This is more difficult than it sounds because libunwind</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   isn&#39;t installed everywhere by default. It&#39;s also a bit of a hefty library,</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   so possibly not the best option. When testing, libunwind was excellent at</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   getting both accurate backtraces and accurate symbols across platforms.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   This route was not chosen in favor of the next option, however.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// * We&#39;re already using libgcc_s for exceptions in rust (triggering thread</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   unwinding and running destructors on the stack), and it turns out that it</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   conveniently comes with a function that also gives us a backtrace. All of</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   these functions look like _Unwind_*, but it&#39;s not quite the full</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   repertoire of the libunwind API. Due to it already being in use, this was</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   the chosen route of getting a backtrace.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// After choosing libgcc_s for backtraces, the sad part is that it will only</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// give us a stack trace of instruction pointers. Thankfully these instruction</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// pointers are accurate (they work for green and native threads), but it&#39;s</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// then up to us again to figure out how to translate these addresses to</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// symbols. As with before, we have a few options. Before, that, a little bit</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// of an interlude about symbols. This is my very limited knowledge about</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// symbol tables, and this information is likely slightly wrong, but the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// general idea should be correct.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// When talking about symbols, it&#39;s helpful to know a few things about where</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// symbols are located. Some symbols are located in the dynamic symbol table</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// of the executable which in theory means that they&#39;re available for dynamic</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// linking and lookup. Other symbols end up only in the local symbol table of</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// the file. This loosely corresponds to pub and priv functions in Rust.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// Armed with this knowledge, we know that our solution for address to symbol</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// translation will need to consult both the local and dynamic symbol tables.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// With that in mind, here&#39;s our options of translating an address to</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// a symbol.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// * Use dladdr(). The original backtrace()-based idea actually uses dladdr()</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   behind the scenes to translate, and this is why backtrace() was not used.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   Conveniently, this method works fantastically on OSX. It appears dladdr()</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   uses magic to consult the local symbol table, or we&#39;re putting everything</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   in the dynamic symbol table anyway. Regardless, for OSX, this is the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   method used for translation. It&#39;s provided by the system and easy to do.o</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   Sadly, all other systems have a dladdr() implementation that does not</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   consult the local symbol table. This means that most functions are blank</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   because they don&#39;t have symbols. This means that we need another solution.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// * Use unw_get_proc_name(). This is part of the libunwind api (not the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   libgcc_s version of the libunwind api), but involves taking a dependency</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   to libunwind. We may pursue this route in the future if we bundle</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   libunwind, but libunwind was unwieldy enough that it was not chosen at</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   this time to provide this functionality.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// * Shell out to a utility like `readelf`. Crazy though it may sound, it&#39;s a</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   semi-reasonable solution. The stdlib already knows how to spawn processes,</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   so in theory it could invoke readelf, parse the output, and consult the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   local/dynamic symbol tables from there. This ended up not getting chosen</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   due to the craziness of the idea plus the advent of the next option.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// * Use `libbacktrace`. It turns out that this is a small library bundled in</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   the gcc repository which provides backtrace and symbol translation</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   functionality. All we really need from it is the backtrace functionality,</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   and we only really need this on everything that&#39;s not OSX, so this is the</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///   chosen route for now.</span>
<span class='doccomment'>///</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// In summary, the current situation uses libgcc_s to get a trace of stack</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// pointers, and we use dladdr() or libbacktrace to translate these addresses</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// to symbols. This is a bit of a hokey implementation as-is, but it works for</span>
<span class='doccomment'>/// all unix platforms we support right now, so it at least gets the job done.</span>

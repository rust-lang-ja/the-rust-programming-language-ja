 There are additional rules regarding the next token after a metavariable:
 
-* `expr` variables may only be followed by one of: `=> , ;`
-* `ty` and `path` variables may only be followed by one of: `=> , : = > as`
-* `pat` variables may only be followed by one of: `=> , = if in`
+* `expr` and `stmt` variables may only be followed by one of: `=> , ;`
+* `ty` and `path` variables may only be followed by one of: `=> , = | ; : > [ { as where`
+* `pat` variables may only be followed by one of: `=> , = | if in`
 * Other variables may be followed by any token.
 
 These rules provide some flexibility for Rustâ€™s syntax to evolve without
 breaking existing macros.
 
 The macro system does not deal with parse ambiguity at all. For example, the
-grammar `$($t:ty)* $e:expr` will always fail to parse, because the parser would
-be forced to choose between parsing `$t` and parsing `$e`. Changing the
+grammar `$($i:ident)* $e:expr` will always fail to parse, because the parser would
+be forced to choose between parsing `$i` and parsing `$e`. Changing the
 invocation syntax to put a distinctive token in front can solve the problem. In
-this case, you can write `$(T $t:ty)* E $e:exp`.
+this case, you can write `$(I $i:ident)* E $e:expr`.
